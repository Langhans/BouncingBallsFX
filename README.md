# BouncingBallsFX

I got excited reading about the Javafxports-project, Gluonhq.com charm down, et cetera. Shortly: The ability to run Javafx-applications on so many different platforms and still be able to address platformspecific resources. BouncingBallsFX was written in two days (Nights, I have two children) before I first committed to Github. Nothing spectacular, just bouncing javafx-Spheres with simple materials, following some rules like that there are walls, gravity, an animation that makes the balls wobble when hitting the floor or a wall. Even listening to zoom, rotate and swipe gestures.

Careful, not properly working yet!

Thanks GluonHQ.com!
